The application employs a new pose invariant face recognition deep neural network algorithm with a very low error rate. To achieve this, the authors built a novel dataset with over five million labeled faces, fine-tuned the deep convolutional neural network (CNN) VGG-16 architecture on this dataset, and deployed the model on a Raspberry Pi 3 using the OpenCV dnn module. The paper discusses the importance of facial recognition technology, the use of deep learning techniques for face recognition systems, and the challenges associated with collecting large face datasets for training purposes."}]
